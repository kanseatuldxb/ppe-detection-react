# Show Me Your PPE
[Link](https://show-me-your-ppe.web.app/)

This is a web application designed to tackle work safety issues in the construction industry. 

The application detects for personal protective equipment (PPE) on a person and sends an "Access Granted" alert when the user is wearing proper PPE. We are focusing this project on the detection of hardhats and high-vis vests. However, this application can be easily modified to other TF.JS models.

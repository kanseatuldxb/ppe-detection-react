        answer: <div>To start the project, you can either click on the "Start Detection" button at the top of the page, or the play button on the bottom right section of the screen. <br /><br />Once you're in the program, please make sure to allow camera access to the browser. Test it out by wearing a hard-hat and a high-vis vest and let it start!</div>

                  In the manufacturing industry, casualties and accidents happen in workplaces every year.  
                  <br /><br /><i>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</i> like a helmet (hard-hat), safety-harness, and goggles play a very important role in ensuring the safety of workers. 
                  These equipment are critical to protect people from casualties and accidents.
                  <br /><br />However, due to the negligence of the workers and their supervisors, workplace accidents occuring from a lack of proper equipment still occur. Supervisors often don't monitor workplace safety consistently because such tasks can be seen as cumbersome.</div>

                  To combat this problem, we created a system backed by a trained machine learning model to automatically detect the use of correct PPE. 
                  <br /><br />This project aims to ensure that workers are wearing proper PPE before they enter the workplace. It can assist supervisors to monitor workers effectively by providing them with real-time alerts, without the need to be on-site all the time.
                  <br /><br />By developing this project, we hope that this eases the supervisors' burden of constant workplace monitoring, and allow them to focus on other aspects of workplace safety.
